- **Closure (first definition)** : Being able to refer to a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope. It basically allows you to make functions with functions. 

- **Closure (second definition)** : A function that references bindings from local scopes around it.

- **Function : a procedure** : a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. It should take some input and return an output where there is an obvious relationship between input and output. 

- **Primitive (primitive value / data type)** : Data that is not an object and has no methods. There are 6 primitives: undefined, boolean, Number, String, BigInt, Symbol. 

- **Parameter** : The inputs of a function

- **Body** : Statements of code that runs in a function

- **Value** : Optional result to send back in a function using return statement. 

- **Expression** : A fragment of code that produces a value. “Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression. An expression between parentheses is also an expression, as is a binary operator applied to two expressions or a unary operator applied to one.”

- **Statement** : “If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript statement corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements.”

- **Side Effect** : Showing a dialogue box or text on the screen. Anything that is not a return statement. 

- **Binding/Variable** : Is used to catch and hold a value, otherwise it will immediately disappear when the program runs past it. let means a bind will be defined. The name of the binding is right after let. And if I want to give it a value, it is defined in an expression after an =. 

- **const/constant** : Defines a constant binding, which points at the same value for as long as it lives

- **Environment** : the collection of bindings, their values, that exist in any given moment is called the environment

- **Key words** : reserved words in JavaScript, include things like for, while, break, etc 

- **Numbers** : simply numeric values. 

- **Arithmetic** : operations like addition, mod, subtraction, etc. Of course, the main thing you do with numbers is arithmetic operations. 

- **Special Numbers** : Are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal ones. There are three total: infinity, -infinity, NaN. 

- **Strings** : They represent Text. Written using quotes, whether single, double, or backticks, they work.

- **Scope** : The part of the program in which a binding is visible. For bindings defined outside of a function or block, the scope encompasses the entire program - these bindings can be referred to anywhere in the program. 

- **Block** :  The code inside of brackets (like in a function). They are used to group 0 or more statements. In languages other than JavaScript it is called a compound statement. 

- **Global** : Used to describe bindings that are visible (can be used) anywhere in a program. Bindings declared with var in loops and functions are global. 

- **Local** : Refers to bindings that can only be accessed within a limited section of a program, such as let and const bindings created within the block of a function or in a function’s parameters.

- **Environment** : The area a function acts in. This includes the block as well as the area in the program where you called the function. 

- **Nested Scope** : Refers to when blocks or functions are created within another block or function: this produces a hierarchy or degree of locality. 

- **Call Stack** : The order the computer goes through when a function is called. Since a function must return a value to the spot where it was called, the computer must remember the order/context in where each return statement should be sent. This data is stored in the call stack. 

- **Lexical Scoping** : Each local scope can see the local scopes that contain it, and all scopes can see the global scope. 

- **Recursion** : Occurs when a function calls itself. It is useful when you want to solve a problem by calculating every possibility to an answer until you find the right one.
