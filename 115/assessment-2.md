- I am really looking forward to understanding more of the work flow for professional developers. One aspect of that is using Git in a group environment - that will be fun, just because we have done everything in one-person projects so far. If possible, I also look forward to learning more nifty Git commands that make collaboration easier. Larger scale projects will also be interesting, just because we have only done small scale projects - I look forward to making bigger and cooler things!

- Event propagation is the sum of the processes of bubbling and capturing, and can be explained using the example of a `<p>` nested inside of a `<div>`. When an event listener is attached to the `<p>` and then that event is activated, the capturing phase of propagation runs. In this phase, the document propagates down the DOM tree (information about the event is passed from one node to the next) all the way to the target element: in this example it is the `<p>`. Once it gets to the target element and calls the event for it, it then propagates back up the DOM tree, called the bubbling phase, and activates any event attached to the parent elements of the target element. In this example, one of the parent elements would be the `<div>`.

- One type of event is the mouse event. Two properties of that event are MouseEvent.pageX and MouseEvent.ctrlKey. The pageX property returns the horizontal position of the mouse pointer when it clicks on a target element with a mouse event listener attached to it. The ctrlKey property just returns a value of true if the control key was pressed down when the mouse event listener ran.
Another type of event is the keyboard event. Two properties of the keyboard event are KeyboardEvent.key and KeyboardEvent.alt.The key property returns a string consisting of the key that is pressed, and the alt property returns a boolean on whether or not the alt key was held down when the keyboard event was fired.
