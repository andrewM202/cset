  - I think my biggest challenge with this program will be making sure that I utilize all the resources available to me in this course fully. There are all the 
  reference links and extra resources to look over in order to make sure I can cement my understanding for the long term. So far, I think I understand 
  everything in the book well so far, and I am taking good notes and am getting even better are organizing them. However, I need to push myself a bit more
  and find extra stuff to learn not included just in the textbook or slideshows we go through. Overall, I think I am having a good time learning everything,
  I just know that I have more room to fill as far as learning and that I have to get myself to spend the extra time to do it. 
  
 - For loops must have a starting variable with a value, an ending conditional, and a conditional for how the starting variable increases each iteration of the loop. 
 Meanwhile, a while loop only requires a conditional to determine if it runs, where the loop will always run as long as the conditional is still true. Therefore, 
 the while loop sort of "holds your hand" less than a for loop. It is your job to make sure the while loop does not run infinitely (which while it could happen in 
 a for loop, I feel is less likely to happen), and to initialize a variable outside of the while loop to use in the conditional (you can initialize a variable in 
 the first expression of the for loop). The difference between a do-while loop and a while loop, is that the code in the do-while loop will always run at 
 least once. After running once, it will check the conditional in the while to see if it will run again or not at all, and can run until a memory overflow occurs 
 just like in a while loop. 
  
 - Writing in pseudo-code not only helps you organize your ideas on how to solve a coding problem, it helps you understand your code after you have finished. As
 far as organizing your ideas, it helps you build a logical flow on how your program will look and how you will solve it, before jumping into the fray and 
 writing a lot of code that tangles your mind, and which you soon realize makes no sense or doesn't work before starting over and repeating the process. It
 is especially useful the more complex the code is, because your mind can only remember so much complicated information. The pseudo-code helps you to visualize
 how you are writing such complicated programs, and lays it out one step at a time. And if you want to reutilize your complicated program months later, the 
 pseudo-code will make it much easier to understand what you wrote.
